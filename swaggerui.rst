Swagger UI
============

"Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services. The overarching goal of Swagger is to enable client and documentation systems to update at the same pace as the server. The documentation of methods, parameters, and models are tightly integrated into the server code, allowing APIs to always stay in sync. With Swagger, deploying managing, and using powerful APIs has never been easier." - https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/

FlexSearch uses Swagger to document all the web services endpoint thus giving the developers an easy to use testing and documentation tool. FlexSearch swagger documentation can be accessed from http://localhost:9800/api

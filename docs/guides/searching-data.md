# Running FlexSearch

FlexSearch is a high performance REST/SOAP services based full-text searching platform 
built on top of the popular Lucene search library. At its core it is about extensibility 
and maintainability with minimum overhead. FlexSearch is written in F# & C# 5.0 (.net framework 4.5). 
It exposes REST, SOAP and Binary based web service endpoints enabling easy integration. It has an 
extensive plug-in architecture with ability to customize most of the functionality with minimum amount
of efforts. One area where FlexSearch particularly excel over competition is providing easy extensible 
connector model which allows a developer to tap directly into core's indexing engine, thus avoiding the 
reliance on web services. This results in a greatly improved indexing performance when indexing 
over millions of records.
